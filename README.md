This repository hosts certain parts of Kytos-ng's documentation with `jekyll`

## How to try it out locally

- Make sure you have [`bundler`](https://bundler.io/) and `ruby` (version 2) installed

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

- If ruby 3 is installed as the default version of your OS, you'd have to:

```
bundle-2.7 install
bundle-2.7 exec jekyll serve
```

- Once `jekyll` is running and serving, you should be able to load the docs on http://127.0.0.1:4000/
